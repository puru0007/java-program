            India vs South Africa's second ODI will have millions of eyes glued to their TV screens, as the Blue army attempts to bounce back from Thursday's crushing defeat â€” losing by merely nine runs in Lucknow. With Team India's main squad having departed to Australia for the ICC T20 World Cup, the responsibility now falls onto captain Shikhar Dhawan, who admitted that his team fielded poorly during the death overs. South Africa currently leads the three-day tournament, with a 1-0 lead.
        </p>The 2nd India vs South Africa One Day International match is scheduled for Sunday, October 9 from 1:30pm IST, at the JSCA International Stadium Complex in Ranchi. The coin toss normally takes place about an hour before the match, though the first ODI saw a delay, thanks to sudden rainfall in Lucknow.
