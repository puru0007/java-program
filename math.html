            The Department of Mathematics, one of the pioneering departments of the institution, came into existence in the year 1961.The department since its inception, catered to the needs of UG and PG engineering departments, later included management department in the series.The department launched Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program in 1987 and Master of Technology (M.Tech) program in Bioinformatics in 2006.It also runs Doctorate programs in Mathematics, Computer Applications and Bioinformatics and has so far produced a good number of PhDs out of which many are pursuing Postdoctoral studies abroad.The department comprises of well qualified and research oriented faculty members working in various application areas of mathematics.
            The vision of the department is to become a centre of excellence in Mathematics through high quality research and teaching.

Mathematics is widely used in all the major engineering fields. In most of the engineering discipline, many practical problems, physical laws and relations is translated into mathematical models. The department of Mathematics is dedicated to impart high quality education in Mathematics to the undergraduate engineering students for helping them to solve challenging problems by using mathematical theories and models. Along with the teaching responsibilities, the faculty members are actively involved in research.

From the academic year 2019-20, the department of Mathematics has started to offer a 2-year Master of Science (M.Sc.) programme in the discipline of Mathematics and Computing. The department offer PhD program in various research areas of Mathematics. We look forward to seeing you in the department.
