            The department has started with the aim to cater the need of B. Tech first year compulsory courses (Engineering Chemistry & Environmental Sciences). The department also offers, a PG program (M.Sc. Chemistry) and a doctoral program (Ph.D.) in various disciplines of chemistry and inter-disciplinary branches. <br>
            The chemistry department has a rich tradition of imparting high-quality teaching and research in cutting-edge thrust areas of chemical science, providing intensive research training to students and research scholars. The students have access to a seminar library where a large collection of international and national reputed journals and textbooks are housed. Besides this, the department has a state-of-art instrumentation facility and laboratory infrastructure for conducting quality research.<br> The department was awarded SAP-UGC (DRS-1) program in 2009 and the DST-FIST program in 2011. The SAP-UGC (DRS-II) was awarded in 2014 with an amount of 1.5 Crore. The department has smart classrooms and procured high-end instruments for research with the support of the DST-PURSE program. The department of chemistry organized workshops, symposia, and national and international conferences on thrust areas of chemical sciences. A large number of postgraduate students have qualified NET and GATE examinations every year. During the last 5 years, the department has produced 60 Ph.Ds and published 1205 research papers in Scopus indexed journals during 2011-2020.
