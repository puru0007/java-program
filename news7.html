            The clock is ticking, and soon 2022 will arrive with all the fresh resolutions, hopes, and plans for what a new year will bring.  <br>

            This year you helped us celebrate 20 years of open sharing, and in big ways and small showed up with generosity on behalf of OpenCourseWare. Whether you volunteered your time, donated your money, helped grow our online community, or shared your learning journey with us, we are deeply grateful to everyone who helped make this milestone year one to remember.
