            The computer science and engineering department was established in the year 1986. Since the inception, it is consistently creating its place of excellence not only within the institute but among its counter parts in the country and abroad. Bright students from all the parts of the country for quality education in computer science and engineering at under graduate, post graduate, and doctoral levels are attracted. The department has highly qualified and competent faculty members, and adequate facilities to support teaching and learning activity.

Programme Educational Objectives

        To develop a high level of technical expertise so that students are able to succeed positions in Computer science and engineering practice or research and in other fields they choose to pursue.
