The UG course of the department has been awarded "A' grade by the National Board of Accreditation. The department has 11 well equipped laboratories which provide good facilities for teaching, field testing, consultancy and research works in Civil Engineering. The department has a Hydro Research Laboratory which is one of its kind in an educational Institution in the country for hydraulic machine model testing, The department ensures regular updating of the curriculum of all courses, in consultation with industries and academician. The placement of students through campus interviews is very good in terms of number and packages.

The faculty members have been delivering expert lectures for engineers from fields and industries at various organizations. The department faculty have 2 patents. The faculty is also generating substantial revenue through  testing and consultancy works. In the recent scenario of globalization and Indian Economy, infrastructure development and conservation of Water Resources and Environment, focus is on :

* National Highway Development Project

* Prime Ministers Gramin Sadak Yojna

* Housing Development and Other Building Activity.

* Power Generation Including Irrigation Facilities.

* Environmental Protection and Conservation like Bhoj Wetland and Chilka Lake Projects.

* Petroleum Sector - Bina Refinery (India-Oman Project)

All these above projects will need large number of Civil Engineers in coming 15 years.

We at MANIT look at this as a challenge and opportunity and are fully committed to serve the nation by providing excellent quality engineers to the Profession.
