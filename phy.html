        The department runs an M.Tech. course in Nanotechnology since 2006 with an intake of 18 students.  A center of Nanoscience and Engineering is formed within the department in 2014 The Department and the centre is engaged in research leading to Ph.D. and teaching in the frontier areas of experimental sciences. These include Nanoscience & Nanotechnology, condensed matter physics and materials science.

        Excellence in research and teaching has been the hallmark of this Department. Apart from our own research in the leading edge since its inception, the Department has, over the years, produced some of the brightest minds in Physics, active both in the country and all over the world, with several fundamental contributions in the field.

        Physics is a branch of pure science, dealing with the study and analysis of physical phenomena that take place around us, the nature of the forces responsible for them, and accurate measurement of the physical parameters involved, their interdependence and the laws governing them. This leads to a better understanding of the universe we live in. The laboratory sessions are intended to give the students a hands-on experience of the experiments that enable the verification of the knowledge gained in the theory classes. Problem solving hones the analytical and rational thinking of the students in applying their knowledge to practical situations in life. A degree with physics as one of the optional subjects equips a student to pursue a career in teaching. There is a plethora of research opportunities available in various research institutions available in various Research Institutions of National repute and placements in Research and Development Departments of Scientific Organizations.
